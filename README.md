# W0ne7_Arduino

This is a simple example code for use with PTRB's W0ne7. 

The code, once loaded on to an arduino UNO will map the W0ne7's 7 switches to keyboard presses (a through g)

In doing this, the W0ne7 is compatible with games/simulators that accept keyboard inputs. 

Basic knowlege (enough to build your own button box) is assumed, but to run this code download the .ino file, open it in the Arduino IDE and load it on to your arduino. Once you have hooked up the W0ne7 to your arduino that should be it, you are good to go.

Please note, this is an example/demo only, please feel free to integrate the W0ne7 into your button box using whatever code you like.
